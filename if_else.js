// <Conditional Statements
// Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

// You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

// In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

// Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
// Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
// Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
// Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed>
