avaScript is a popular programming language that has a wide range of applications.

JavaScript was previously used mainly for making webpages interactive such as form validation, animation, etc. Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:

Using console tab of web browsers
Using Node.js
By creating web pages

==============================================================================================

Using Console Tab of Web Browsers
All the popular web browsers have built-in JavaScript engines. Hence, you can run JavaScript on a browser. To run JavaScript on a browser,

Open your favorite browser (here we will use Google Chrome).
Open the developer tools by right clicking on an empty area and select Inspect. Shortcut: F12.

===========================================================================================================

Node is a back-end run-time environment for executing JavaScript code. To run JS using Node.js, follow these steps:

Install the latest version of Node.js.
Install an IDE/Text Editor like Visual Studio Code. In VS code, create a file > write JS code > save it with .js extension.

By Creating Web Pages
JavaScript was initially created to make web pages interactive, that's why JavaScript and HTML go hand in hand. To run JS from a webpage, follow these steps:

Open VS Code > Go to File > New File > Save it with .html extension. For example, main.html.
Copy this doctype (minimum valid HTML code) and save it in the file.
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <title>Programiz</title>
</head>

<body>
  <script src=""></script>
</body>
</html>


Similarly create a JS file, write the following JS code and save it with .js extension like main.js.
console.log('hello world');
